# php-restaurant
I coded this from scratch utilizing PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is a fun example of a restaurant--my home kitchen--and some random meal examples. I used PHP to make the menu food items dynamic, created a suggested tip amount using PHP, and coded a simple contact form.

You can see the code live at my portfolio at http://www.davidmdugger.com/php-restaurant.

And, of course, you can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmdugger/
