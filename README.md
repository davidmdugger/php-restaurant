# php-restaurant
I coded this from scratch utilizing PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is a fun example of a restaurant--my home kitchen--and some random meal examples. I used PHP to make the menu food items dynamic, created a suggested tip amount using PHP, and coded a simple contact form.

You can see the code live, in action, at my portfolio at http://www.davidmdugger.com/php-restaurant.
